# Homebrew Cask for Vantage
#
# DISTRIBUTION: This cask is published to Sensey's existing tap,
# senseylabs/homebrew-tap (the same tap that hosts the Kagi CLI formula).
# A single tap hosts both Formula/ and Casks/ — this GUI .app lives under
# Casks/. Users install it with:
#   brew install --cask senseylabs/tap/vantage
# (Homebrew expands "senseylabs/tap" -> "senseylabs/homebrew-tap" automatically.)
#
# ON EACH RELEASE — the release workflow renders this file into the tap with:
#   1. version  — bumped to the new semantic version
#   2. sha256   — computed from the notarized Vantage-<version>.zip
#   3. url      — the version is embedded via #{version} interpolation (automatic)
#

  # #{version} is substituted automatically by Homebrew at install time.

  # Uninstall and zap
  #
  # uninstall quits the running app before removal so the .app can be replaced
  # cleanly on upgrade (Vantage runs as a menu-bar accessory).
  #
  # zap removes user data and preferences that Homebrew won't touch otherwise,
  # including the file-sink log under ~/Library/Logs/Vantage.
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  uninstall quit: "com.sensey.vantage"

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Accessibility caveat
  #
  # Vantage installs a global CGEventTap to intercept cmd+tab. After
  # installation the user must grant Accessibility permission once:
  #   System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → Vantage → ON
  #
  # With a Developer ID signature (which this cask requires) the TCC grant
  # is stable across updates — the cdhash is consistent because the signing
  # identity does not change between builds.
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  caveats <<~EOS
    Vantage requires Accessibility permission to intercept cmd+tab:

      System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → Vantage (toggle ON)

    You only need to do this once. The permission persists across updates.
